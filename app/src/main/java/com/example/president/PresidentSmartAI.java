    /**
     * This class will contain our smart AI
     * We haven't gotten a chance to start our smart AI but we have the algorithm down
     * The smart AI will see what cards have been placed and than go through it's own cards
     * For example if the player played two sixes than the AI will try to find the two sevens or two eights
     * If the AI has both two sevens and two eights than the AI will play the two eights because it would force the next player to play something higher
     * The AI will press pass only if it needs to unlike the dumb AI
     * The Smart AI's goal is to win the game as fast as possible; this involves making it extremely hard for the next player to place a card and forcing them to press pass
